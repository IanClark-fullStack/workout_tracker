Built using Express Servers, Mongo Database and Mongoose. 

Application Features 
- Create workouts
- Track workouts: Including total distance, total time spent and total weight used. 
- Log multiple workouts within a one session

- Each workout provides the user with options to track the name of the workout, its type, number of sets as well as reps and the duration of time spent. When the workout is cardio, users will also be given the option to input distance.
